# ✅ FINAL SETUP - SERVERS RUNNING WITH YOUR IMAGES!

## 🎉 WHAT I JUST DID:

### 1. ✅ Moved All Your Images to Assets Folder
- ✅ `logo.png` → `frontend/src/assets/images/logo.png`
- ✅ `hr-avatar.png` → `frontend/src/assets/images/hr-avatar.png`
- ✅ `background1.jpg` → `frontend/src/assets/images/background1.jpg`
- ✅ `background2.jpg` → `frontend/src/assets/images/background2.jpg`

### 2. ✅ Updated Login Page to Use Your Images
- **Your logo.png** is now displayed at the top
- **background1.jpg** is used as the login page background
- **Overlay effect** for better readability
- **Modern card design** with your branding

### 3. ✅ Cleared All Caches
- Cleared React build cache
- Stopped all old Node processes
- Fresh restart of both servers

### 4. ✅ Started Servers in Separate Windows
- Backend running in its own PowerShell window
- Frontend running in its own PowerShell window
- Both servers stay running independently

## 🎨 YOUR IMAGES ARE NOW BEING USED:

// Then use in JSX:
<img src={hrAvatar} alt="Avatar" className="w-20 h-20 rounded-full" />
```

## 🖥️ SERVER STATUS:

You should now have **2 separate PowerShell windows** open:

### Window 1 - Backend:
```
Server running in development mode on port 5000
MongoDB Connected: ac-siv5hkk-shard-00-XX.alzouxa.mongodb.net
```

### Window 2 - Frontend:
```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view hr-leave-tracker-frontend in the browser.
Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

**Don't close these windows!** Keep them running.

---

## 🚀 WHAT TO DO NOW:

### Step 1: Verify Servers Are Running
Check both PowerShell windows show success messages (above).

### Step 2: Open Your Browser
- ✅ Chrome / Edge / Firefox only
- ❌ NOT VS Code Simple Browser

### Step 3: Go to the Application
Type in address bar: **http://localhost:3000**

### Step 4: What You'll See
1. **Your logo (logo.png)** at the top center
2. **Your background (background1.jpg)** covering the full page
3. **Login form** with white card and dark overlay
4. **Test credentials** card at the bottom

### Step 5: Login
Use any credentials from the list above.

---

## 🔧 IF LOGIN DOESN'T WORK:

### Check These First:

1. **Backend running?**
   - Look at Backend PowerShell window
   - Should say "MongoDB Connected"

2. **Frontend compiled?**
   - Look at Frontend PowerShell window
   - Should say "Compiled successfully!"

3. **Browser console errors?**
   - Press F12 in browser
   - Click Console tab
   - Look for red errors

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue: "Cannot POST /api/auth/login"**
- Backend is not running
- Restart backend window

**Issue: Network Error**
- Backend crashed or stopped
- Check backend window for errors
- Restart it: `npm start`

**Issue: Blank page after login**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Clear localStorage:
  - F12 → Application → Local Storage → Clear All
  - Refresh page

**Issue: Images not showing**
- Frontend is still compiling
- Wait 30 more seconds
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+F5

## 📸 IMAGE FILE LOCATIONS (FOR YOUR REFERENCE):

All images are now in:
```
frontend/
  src/
    assets/
      images/
        ├── logo.png          (Your main logo - used on login)
        ├── hr-avatar.png     (User avatar - ready to use)
        ├── background1.jpg   (Login page background - in use)
        └── background2.jpg   (Available for other pages)
```

---

## 🎯 QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING:

```powershell
# If servers stopped, restart them:

# Kill any stuck processes:
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -eq "node"} | Stop-Process -Force

# Start backend:
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd 'C:\Users\arunc\Downloads\MERN_STACK_PROJECTs\HR_LEAVE_TRACKER\backend'; npm start"

# Wait 5 seconds, then start frontend:
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoExit", "-Command", "cd 'C:\Users\arunc\Downloads\MERN_STACK_PROJECTs\HR_LEAVE_TRACKER\frontend'; npm start"
```

---
