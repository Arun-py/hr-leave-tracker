# ✅ All Issues Fixed and Resolved

## 🎯 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ❌ Error: "Not Found - /api"
**Issue:** Frontend was trying to access `/api` endpoint which didn't exist on the backend.

**Root Cause:** No handler for the `/api` root endpoint.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `/api` endpoint handler in `server.js` that returns API status and available endpoints
- Provides useful API documentation when accessed directly

**File Modified:** `backend/server.js`

```javascript
// API root endpoint
app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ 
    status: 'OK',
    message: 'HR Leave Tracker API is running...',
    version: '1.0.0',
    endpoints: {
      auth: '/api/auth',
      leaves: '/api/leaves',
      attendance: '/api/attendance',
      hr: '/api/hr',
      admin: '/api/admin',
      notifications: '/api/notifications',
      companies: '/api/companies',
      public: '/api/public'
    }
  });
});
```

### 2. ❌ Error: Missing 'restrictTo' Export
**Issue:** `companyRoutes.js` was importing `restrictTo` from `authMiddleware.js` but it wasn't exported.

**Root Cause:** Missing role-based access control function in auth middleware.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `restrictTo` function to `authMiddleware.js`
- Implements role-based access control middleware
- Allows restricting routes to specific user roles

**File Modified:** `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js`

```javascript
// Restrict access to specific roles
export const restrictTo = (...roles) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user || !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        message: 'You do not have permission to perform this action' 
      });
    }
    next();
  };
};
```

### 3. ❌ Database Seeding Errors
**Issue:** User validation failed - "Company domain is required, Company is required"

**Root Cause:** User model requires `company` and `companyDomain` fields for multi-company support, but seed script wasn't providing them.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `company: 'TechCorp Solutions'` to all user records
- Added `companyDomain: 'company.com'` to all user records
- Updated seed script for employees, admin, and HR accounts

**File Modified:** `backend/scripts/seedDatabase.js`

**Changes:**
1. Employee creation - Added company fields
2. Admin user creation - Added company fields
3. HR user creation - Added company fields

---

### 4. ❌ Leave Validation Failed
**Issue:** Leave validation failed - "companyDomain is required"

**Root Cause:** Leave model requires `companyDomain` field but seed script wasn't providing it.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `companyDomain: 'company.com'` to all leave requests in seed data

**File Modified:** `backend/scripts/seedDatabase.js`
