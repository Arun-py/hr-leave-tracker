## üîç How Company Filtering Works

### 1. **Login Response**
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "name": "Oracle HR",
  "email": "hr@oracle.com",
  "role": "HR",
  "company": "Oracle",
  "companyDomain": "oracle.com",
  "employeeId": "ORA-HR001",
  "token": "..."
}
```

### 2. **HR Dashboard (GET /api/hr/dashboard)**
Automatically filters by `companyDomain`:
```javascript
// HR sees only their company
if (req.user.role === 'HR') {
  query.companyDomain = req.user.companyDomain;
}
// Admin sees all companies
```

### 3. **Employee List (GET /api/hr/employees)**
```javascript
// HR at Oracle: Gets only Oracle employees
// HR at Snapdragon: Gets only Snapdragon employees
// Admin: Gets ALL employees
```

### 4. **Leave Requests (GET /api/hr/leave-requests)**
```javascript
// HR can only approve leaves from their company
if (req.user.role === 'HR') {
  query.companyDomain = req.user.companyDomain;
}
```
