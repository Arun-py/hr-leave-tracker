## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### About "Password Breach" Warning:
When you login, Chrome may show: *"Password found in a data breach"*

**This is EXPECTED and SAFE because:**
- These are TEST passwords (`admin123`, `password123`)
- This is a LOCAL development app (not on the internet)
- These passwords are intentionally simple for testing
- **Just click "Never" or ignore the warning**

### About VS Code Simple Browser:
**DO NOT USE IT!** It has compatibility issues.

**Use these instead:**
- ‚úÖ Google Chrome
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge  
- ‚úÖ Mozilla Firefox
